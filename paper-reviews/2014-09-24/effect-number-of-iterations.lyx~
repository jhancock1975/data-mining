\begin_layout Part*
A Review of: The Effect of Number of Iterations on Ensemble Gene Selection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of the paper is to determine how many iterations for feature selection
 we need in order for the feature selection to be stable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ensemble gene selection in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "key-3"

\end_inset

refers to using an ensemble technique, either data diversity or hybrid of
 data diversity and functional diversity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Iterations in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-3"

\end_inset

 refers to the number of times we apply a feature selection technique.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-3"

\end_inset

 mentions that feature selection is important when dealing with bioinformatic
 data because we are dealing with data that has high dimensionality.
 We also have a problem feature selection instability.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset

: we know ensemble techniques are powerful for classifiers, we want to try
 this on feature selection, using data diversity and hybrid diversity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The aggregation technique used in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-3"

\end_inset

 is mean aggregation.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-3"

\end_inset

 explains how to do mean aggretation: compute the mean rank of an attribute
 for all feature selection techniques used in an ensemble feature selection
 technique, and use this mean value as the rank of the attribute.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 1 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 explains data diversity ensemble feature selection technique: sample data
 with replacement to generate 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 data sets, apply 
\shape italic
same 
\shape default
ranker, obtain
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 feature lists, finally aggregate the lists.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 2 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 exlains hybrid ensemble feature selection technique.
 It is similar to the data diversity approach.
 The key difference is to use 
\shape italic
different
\shape default
 rankers for each data set.
 After applying the rankers to the data sets, we obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 lists of attributes, and we aggregate the results.

Ranking techniques used in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-3"

\end_inset

: The threshold based feature selection techniques used are: Mutual Information,
 Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Deviance, Geometric Mean, Area Under ROC, and Area
 Under PRC.
 The non-threshold based feature selection techniques are: Chi Squared,
 Information Gain, ReliefF, and Signal to noise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For both kinds of ensemble feature selection - data diversity or hybrid
 the authors of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-3"

\end_inset

 use 26 bioinformatic datasets and 80 total different feature selection
 techniques depending on the number of iterations.
 Note: 80 = 50 + 20 +10 is the different numbers of iterations used to generate
 bags.
 If we have more than 10 iterations, we use one of the 10 rankers repeatedly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note: paper uses 26 datasets.
 To get an idea of the degree of dimensionality: the numbers of attributes
 are all in the thousands.
 The lowest number of attributes is 2001, we see at least three datasets
 with over 50,000 attributes.

\begin_layout Standard
The stability measure used in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-3"

\end_inset

is the consistency index.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The stability of feature subsets is measured for different subsets ranging
 in size from 5 to 1000.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-3"

\end_inset

 are obtained columns are taking top 5, 10, and so on features that results
 from feature selection using 10 vs 20 iterations, and then using the formula
 for stability index to compare how the sets of features are changing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results show that 20 iterations vs 50 produces stable results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tables II and III in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-3"

\end_inset

 show that 10 iterations is not acceptable because there is a low consistancy
 index score between feature subsets obtained with 10 iterations vs.
 20 iterations or 10 vs.50.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tables II and III also show that data diversity is more stable than hybrid
 diversity as an ensemble feature selection technique.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The conclusions in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-3"

\end_inset

 explain that we find number of iterations to get stable feature set is
 20 or 50.
 Therefore 20 or 50 iterations is the point where we can make a good trade-off
 between stability of features selected and more efficient use of computational
 resources.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Future work propsed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-3"

\end_inset

: study how the number of iterations impacts classification results, as
 well as increasing the number of rankers to more than the 10 used in the
 current work.
